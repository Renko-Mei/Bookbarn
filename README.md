Final project repo

Please see http://localhost:5000. It may take up to 5 mins to start the dotnet server after the `vagrant up` or `vagrant provision` command completes!! Until that time you will see something like "connection was reset" as an error message.

To restart the server with your code changes: 
    * `vagrant halt`
    * `vagrant up`
